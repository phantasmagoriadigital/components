# Design Tokens

The design tokens for this component library can be found on the `src/assets/tokens` directory.

These are not the source tokens but rather generated by Style Dictionary. The design tokens are maintained in a separate repository.
[Github repository](https://github.com/phantasmagoriadigital/sux-style-dictionary)

## Stuff to do

- Design Tokens structure has not been finalized and semantic layer needs to be created
- Currently implemented using scss variable, need to migrate to css vars
