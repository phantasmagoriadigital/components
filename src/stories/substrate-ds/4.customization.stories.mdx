# Customization

If you're new to using Web Components, you'll quickly notice that the traditional way of styling elements with CSS doesn't work with Astro components.

For example, this won't work:

```html
<sux-button style="background:red;">button</sux-button>
```

This is a feature of the Shadow DOM--outside styles cannot be applied to content inside the Shadow DOM. Shadow DOM gives us a clean, native way
of encapsulating styles and protects your applications from breaking changes. Luckily, the Shadow DOM API provides two solutions
to this problem: CSS Custom Properties and CSS Shadow Parts.

## Using CSS Custom Properties

Each component API has a set of CSS Custom Properties defined. These are variables that you can set externally that will reflect inside the Shadow DOM.
CSS Custom Properties are a lot like SASS variables, with one significant difference--they can be swapped at run time and do not require any build process.
These CSS Custom Properties will usually be mapped to some CSS property (color, font-size, border-radius, etc).

If you wanted to change the Button background, you could use the `--button-background-color` custom property like so:

```css
sux-button {
    --button-background-color: red;
}
```
